                    <h1>Dear Chris,</h1>
                    <br>
                    <h2>California</h2>
                    <p class="lol">
                            <br>
                            <span>
                                    Your sweet suckle on soft ground. <br> 
                                    You plant firm kisses deep into the roots spread across the land. <br>
                                    You slowly reach across the stretch of my neck peeling away the skin. <br>
                                    You firmly grab my melting peaches. <br>
                            </span>
                            <br>
                            <span>
                                It is in that moment I'm fully facing you, receiving the holy breaking of hot gold. <br>
                                It is when I first see your beautifully honest smile in full control of me. <br>
                                It is when I recognize your scent I become buried deep into your soft soil. <br>
                            </span>
                            <br>
                            Every fucking star cracks broken shells when you fucking grab my face and fucking teach me the meaning of being together in infinite youth of wild thinking.
                            <br>
        
                            <span>
                                You fucking push me into frozen blue tiles that holds my skin prisoner. <br>
                                You raise my arms with one swift swing and locked them into the cage of your hands. <br>
                                Your other hand crawls over my cream until it reaches thirsty red clay. <br>
                            </span>
                            <br>
                            
                            <span>
                                All I can feel is the the pulse of my blood thickening and getting chopped by the slow taps of your thick fingers. <br>
                                All I can feel is the explosion of my moan when your teeth nibbles my skin. <br>
                                All I can feel is the sky shoot fire through my body, burning the edges of my being. <br>
                                All I want is your sweet toasted bread dipping into softened cream. <br>
                            </span>
                            <br>
                            <span>
                                I feel my water drip down a blanket of soft stars. <br>
                                I feel my breasts squeezed against the infinity mirror of deep space. <br>
                                I feel the warm whisper of your moan steam into my ears. <br>
                                I feel everything with you. <br>
                            </span>
